# DS701 Tools for Data Science Student Assignments

This repository contains the assignments for Fall 2024 edition of DS701, Tools for Data Science.

We suggest you fork the repo to your personal account on GitHub and make separate branches for each of your assignments.

Then, when new assignments are released, you can just sync your fork with the main repo.

We advise against checking in commits to the main branch on your forked repo, as this may make the sync to the main repo fail.
